inheritance is the OOP principle that allows us o create base clases (parent) and extended Classes
it allows us to reuse state and behavior

clasa Mammal -> Horse, Human, Dolphin
Mammal is a Horse?

Child classes (extended/derived) inherit the parent's state & behavior. (only if that is public or protected)
	- can have own behavior/state 
	- can overide parent's behavior/state
