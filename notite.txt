inheritance is the OOP principle that allows us o create base clases (parent) and extended Classes
it allows us to reuse state and behavior

clasa Mammal -> Horse, Human, Dolphin
Mammal is a Horse?

Child classes (extended/derived) inherit the parent's state & behavior. (only if that is public or protected)
	- can have own behavior/state 
	- can overide parent's behavior/state

Mammal

size
weight
name


GivesBirth()
Eats()
Moves()
Talks()
Sleeps()



- multiple inharitance is not posible, only one base class is allowed
- "multiplw inheritance" is done thru interfaces

interfatele 
- a contract that specifies what the calss should implement.
- deffines a set of operations/proprieties/events to be implemented
- doesn't contain state can't be instantiated,
- all interface memebers are public.
- an interface is implemented by a class not inherited by a class. 
- bets practice: interfaces are names with an "I" infront of name: eg: IFlyable.
- can introduce behavior and classes that are not related with each other.
